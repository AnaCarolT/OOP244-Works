During the confection of this workshop, I managed to learn more about string 
manipulation and how to custom my own functions, making prototypes and the 
function itself. It’s a great experience to learn more about strings since 
usually we have the library with all the functions already available, although 
doing one in your own is quite challenging, it is also rewarding. In part 1 of
this workshop, the assignment was to split a code into the proper modules, we
had to set the headers and the cpp files accordingly, we also had to set all of them
in a namespace which should help with the scope of the code. The modules had
to be located properly and following a format to avoid extra libraries or
variables in the code, I tested the modules individually as a stage of the 
compilation, giving a good base for when it’s needed to start a code from 
scratch and set all it’s modules. Part 2 is a DYI, which makes you do your own 
custom fuctions based on the string.h library. We learned about references that 
work similar to a pointer so I decided to test it out in part 2 to make my code 
have a better flow. The prototypes were already provided so I had to follow the 
format provided for my code, usually we use the libraries to make the code more 
readable so not being able to use libraries in this workshop required a little 
more study. Like I mentioned before I tried using reference in some of the 
functions since it makes it easier to work with strings. I did some unit testing
 since I had to do the functions part by part before testing it all together.
