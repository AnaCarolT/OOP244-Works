Doing this workshop gave me a better understanding of how to adapt modules to 
different codes but with similar purposes, in part 1 we worked with a file 
about employees and we had to sort it by salary, the step by step helped me 
realize the areas I had to work on, it took some time even with some functions 
provided but due to that when I started part 2 I already had an idea of what I 
needed to do so I was able to work super fast, separating everything into modules 
makes things more readable in my perspective. I always struggle when it involves 
reading documents or when you need to create multiple modules at once and them
 be able to test the code. Reading the file is the main focus because if you can’t
 read you can’t make the other functions work, I was introduced to new errors, an 
example would be overloaded, which required me to find how to fix it, took some time
 since I’ve never heard some of these errors, overall, I was able to work around it. 
I understood the importance of allocating and deallocating data to prevent memory 
leaks, I was able to get the data, sort, display and then since there is no more 
use for that data, it was deallocated in the main function.
Now discussing about the questions:
In parameter can also be known by pass-by-value parameter, its is often used to 
make sure a value will pass through a function, being able to be used by that 
function but the value of the parameter can’t be modified, meaning it can only 
be “read” by the function. Now, out parameters that can also be called 
pass-by-reference parameter will pass through the function, but it is possible
to change the value of the parameter provided and it will reflect in the original 
argument, so they can be “read” and “written” in this situation.
Yes, the openfile function since it is set as opefile(const char filename[]) . 
The purpose of the this function is to open a file and search for the parameters 
specified so it will pass through(read) and not modify anything, it will go until 
it can’t find anything.
