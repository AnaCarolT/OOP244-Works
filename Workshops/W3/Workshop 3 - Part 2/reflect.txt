This workshop made me learn how to properly handle the private properties in a class
and making the modules step by step made me realized there is multiple ways to pass data
without leaving it public. I also learned a new way to display by filtering it the way
I desire the information to be shown. Besides printing it, I can decide if I want it
fixed, in the left or in the right, I can fill spaces with whatever I need or want, 
I also can decide the width so independent of the data receive, the filter will adjust 
it accordingly for ints, char, doubles, floats. This is very convenient and save me a lot
of time. Due to the quantity of items we are dealing with itâ€™s very important to allocate
and deallocate space or the code can work in unexpected ways. It was quite challenging at
first because I was learning how to make the class give me the information I desired to be
able to format it in the correct display because I would need to use the member functions
in the class that were public to be able to pass the data that was private, so I had to 
create specific member functions just to pass data so I could use it in another cpp file.
I learned a lot doing part 2 because I could really why the member functions were created
this way in part 1.
