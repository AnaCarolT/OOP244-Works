In this workshop I learned the importance of deallocating and allocating memory, 
because when you work with a lot of data It can generate a huge amount of memory 
leak and this is very bad for your coding specially when your code starts getting
more and more complex, this can lead to different issues. I also learned how to set
different formats using cout, at the beginning it was a little confusing but as you
get the hang of it, the coding turns way more clean and way more efficient. The 
cout methods I mean are cout.fill, cout.width, cout.precision, cout.fixed. DYI was 
interesting because I knew how to make most of the functions but I had some issues 
along the way due to the tester be very specific so I needed to analyze each part 
to make my code based in the information provided by it, a lot of times when I was
coding, my code was aborting multiple times because I was not setting enough 
verifications to make my code fit the tester. Overall, I was coding quite fast due
to the base given on part 1 so those new issues make part of the process of learning.
I was having issues with memory leak but it was because I forgot to deallocate in 
one important place.
