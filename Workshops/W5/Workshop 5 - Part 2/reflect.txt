This workshop made me have a better insight of how operators work and how to
call them properly and get the desired result. I was struggling a little bit
at the beginning because I always need to return a value and when I use this*
I need to make sure if I’m sending the value in the class or if it’s the value
I received in the function, sometimes it can be confusing and not really apparent,
I had to use breakpoints multiple times to make I was verifying or getting the right
value. In the first workshop we must set some values to nullptr which can be very
important to not get weird results and end up taking more time trying to figure issues
in the code. Overall, this workshop was amazing because it makes you think in a great
quantity of ways of using the operators, you struggle at first for sure and it may be
more challenging as more complex it turns into but there more ways we learn, the better.
I must be careful because managing the values was required more attention than usual.
Also casting can be done in multiple ways even more when it involves class and operators.
