This workshop taught me how I can use the input and output operators to read 
and write data, since I got used to the method used in IPC which doesn’t include
the <fstream> library, I believe I could have explored more my options than getting
stuck to what I think It’s safe and what I’m used to, for example I’ve never used a
variable with the type string so that got me afraid to use it, but in between
char and string, the better one is the string because instead of guessing how 
long in going to be the input/data, the variable type string already adapts to it, 
since I used a char I had to assume how much it would receive, I decided to assume
that the max would 256 mostly because that’s how I learned to do it with chars, so
standard. Something that also gave me a lot of trouble was to not know how to properly
use the unsigned type ones, most of the time my text was not printing but what I
didn’t realize is that the problem was not my ostream, it was my cstring.cpp
that couldn’t read the unsigned, I kept insisting until I decided to use the <cstring>
library and most of my code was working accordingly, them I could visualize better
what was happening. Although the const char* Textfile::operator[](unsigned) const
looks scary at first, It’s a way to verify the whole object without having the fear
about changing anything by accident. It’s quite simple actually, I was just overthinking it.
Having the copy assignment and copy constructor with the delete keyword was quite
challenging since it would block direct copy of the Line class so I kept removing
and adding it to see the issues. I may have mistakenly forgotten to put them back too.
Those functions being: Line(const Line&) = delete; //copy constructor blocked;
Line& operator=(const Line&) = delete; //copy assignment blocked. Sometimes you
get so many errors that you start deleting things to verify what possibly could
be causing the error. Getting those blocked gave me so many errors that was making
me rethinking how I’m going to handle this situation. The solution was simple,
I just had to use a pointer to most of them. That’s how we end up learning tho,
trial and error. Ifstream and fstream with the operators will turn my life way
easier when it comes to reading and writing files after I get the hang of it.
I usually struggle when it involve files so I always take my sweet time.
